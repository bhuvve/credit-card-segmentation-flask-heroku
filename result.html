         <strong>Cluster 2:</strong> They are potential target customers who are paying bills and doing purchases while maintaining a comparatively good credit score. To increase their transactions, we can increase their credit limit or lower down the interest rate. Additionally, promoting premium cards or loyalty cards can be helpful.

         <strong>Cluster 3:</strong> These customers are taking maximum cash advance, and they should be given reminders for payments. Offers can be provided on early payments to improve their payment rate.
